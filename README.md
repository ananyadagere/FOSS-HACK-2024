## Project Overview
The Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning application designed to predict possible diseases based on input symptoms. It also provides recommendations for medications and injections. This project aims to assist users in obtaining preliminary insights into potential health issues and corresponding treatments.

## Features
- **Symptom Input**: Users can input their symptoms.
- **Disease Prediction**: The model predicts the most likely disease based on the input symptoms.
- **Medication Recommendation**: Provides recommended tablets and injections for the predicted disease.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for user access.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Pip package manager

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
cd disease-prediction
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Running the Application
1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

### User Authentication
1. On the login page, enter your username and password.
2. After logging in, input your symptoms to receive predictions and recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for building the prediction model.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for handling authentication.
